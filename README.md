## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://bookmark-landing-page-master-kappa.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### Continued development

I decided to not add JavaScript to the site because I felt this project was a great starting point to understand SASS. I am still becoming familiar with the basics of JavaScript and have been doing some tests on my own, so I may come back to this project in the future.

SASS is an extremely hepful language that inspired me to organize my file architecture similarly to the 7-1 pattern. Having this modular system helped me compartmentalize areas of the site in a logical manner.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - Kevin Powell has great insights and resource recommendations. This helped me for the majority of the project.
- As always, a little bit of Stack Overflow sprinckled in my helpful resources.
